# JsonStream-vb
This project aims to fill in the gaps for whatever dday9's .NET-JSON-Transformer doesn't do.

## Rationale
The commonly-used Json component for vb.net is GPL v.2 and some programs are not. Therefore, JsonUtil.vb is written completely from scratch. Otherwise, statically utilizing GPL code in a program would require making the rest GPL (See <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/47032/can-i-use-gpl-software-in-a-commercial-application>).
